# 🚀 Day 15 in My Journey to Learning Everyday! 🚀

Today’s learning journey focused on Derived State and the powerful concept of Lifting State Up in React. These are key patterns for managing state effectively in modern React applications. 🎯

🌟 What I Explored Today:

1️⃣ Derived State in React: <br />
Derived state refers to state that is computed from props or other state values.<br />
Key takeaway: It’s better to calculate values dynamically during rendering instead of storing them as state, unless memoization is needed.<br />
Example: Filtering or transforming data passed as props.<br />

2️⃣ Lifting State Up:<br />
Lifting state up centralizes state management in a parent component, allowing child components to share and update the same state.<br />
Helps eliminate prop drilling and redundant states across components.

3️⃣ Best Practices:<br />
Avoid unnecessary derived state to prevent potential bugs and complexity.<br />
Ensure clear communication between components when lifting state up, keeping props manageable and descriptive.<br />

📥 GitHub Repository with Examples:
I’ve uploaded code examples showcasing derived state and lifting state up in action. Check it out here: https://github.com/raj-koshta/derived-state-and-lifting-the-state-up-in-react.git

🔍 Key Takeaways from Today:<br />
--> Derived state simplifies rendering but should be used judiciously to avoid unnecessary re-computations.<br />
--> Lifting state up promotes better component organization and simplifies data flow.<br />
--> Understanding these concepts is crucial for building maintainable and scalable React applications.<br />

🌟 Why This Matters:<br />
Mastering derived state and lifting state up allows developers to manage shared state effectively, making applications more modular and easier to debug.
